# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dilara, a freshman Computer Science student at Bilkent University with a passion for chemistry and a budding Java developer. Welcome to my digital laboratory! ðŸ”¬

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ Studying Computer Science at Bilkent University (1/4)
- â˜• Java Enthusiast (in the Making)
- ðŸ§ª Chemistry Aficionado
- ðŸ“¸ Follow me on Instagram: [@dilaraxqw](https://www.instagram.com/dilaraxqw/)

## Coding with Chemistry

ðŸŒŸ I believe that the world of coding is just as exciting and mysterious as the world of chemistry. Join me as I explore the fascinating intersection of code and chemistry through my projects and experiments.

### ðŸ’» Future Java Projects (for now, just plans)

- [**JavaChemistrySimulator**](https://github.com/dilaraxqw/JavaChemistrySimulator): A Java application that simulates chemical reactions and explores the behavior of molecules. Watch chemistry come alive in your code!

- [**ChemicalEquationBalancer**](https://github.com/dilaraxqw/ChemicalEquationBalancer): A handy Java tool for balancing chemical equations. Say goodbye to those tedious manual calculations!

### ðŸ§ª Chemistry Meets Code

I'm on a mission to combine my love for chemistry and coding. Currently working on [insert your current chemistry-related project here]. Stay tuned for some electrifying results!

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow CS students, aspiring Java developers, and chemistry enthusiasts. Don't hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:dilaraerbenzer.ug.bilkent.edu.tr) or connect with me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dilaraxqw/).

Let's write some code and uncover the mysteries of chemistry together! ðŸ’¡ðŸŒŒ
